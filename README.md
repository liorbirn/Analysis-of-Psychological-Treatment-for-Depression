# Analysis-of-Psychological-Treatment-for-Depression

Overview In this project, I conducted an analysis on a group of subjects characterized by depression. The primary objective was to investigate the effectiveness of psychological treatment in alleviating the symptoms of depression and improving overall well-being. The analysis involved administering a correlation test to the participants before and after the treatment to evaluate any changes in their test scores and assess the correlation between treatment and symptom relief.
